AteotoArena
===========

This is a small 2d RPG-esque fighting game to show off the combat engine of a larger WIP. 

It requires that you have pysfml-cython_ installed and either on the pythonpath, or at the toplevel of the AteotoArena directory.

Currently, the AGE engine is just a subdirectory of this project. It will be spun off into
it's own repository once it is mature and reusable enough.
